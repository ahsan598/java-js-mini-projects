### 🎯 Project Overview

This collection of **mini projects** was developed during my **graduation** practice to enhance my understanding of:

- Building desktop applications using Java Swing
- Connecting Java applications to MySQL using JDBC
- Creating interactive frontend interfaces using JavaScript
- Understanding full-stack development at a beginner level

These projects reflect my ability to integrate **frontend and backend** components, apply object-oriented principles, and follow real-world use cases.

### 🚀 Getting Started

**1. Clone the Repository**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ahsan598/js-mini-projects.git
  cd js-mini-projects
  ```

**2. Import Java Projects**
- Use your preferred IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ)
- Configure the MySQL database credentials in the code


**3. Run Web Projects**
- Open the `.html` file in a browser
- If connected to a backend, start the server (PHP/Node/Java, as applicable)

**4. Setup MySQL Database**
- Import the `.sql` files using MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin


### 🔐 Sample Login Credentials

| Role  | Username | Password |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Admin | admin    | admin123 |
| User  | user     | user123  |

> You can change credentials directly from the MySQL database.
