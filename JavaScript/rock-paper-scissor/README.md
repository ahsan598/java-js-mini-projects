# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game – JavaScript Mini Project

### 📌 Project Overview

A fun and interactive browser-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game developed using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. The user selects an option, the computer randomly chooses its move, and the game logic determines the winner instantly. Designed as part of a frontend practice series to strengthen concepts like **DOM manipulation, event handling**, and basic **game logic** implementation.

---

### 🎯 Objective

- Learn how to build an interactive frontend app with pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Practice DOM manipulation and real-time UI updates
- Handle events like button clicks and dynamic text rendering
- Understand core programming concepts like conditionals, randomness, and game logic


### 🧱 Architecture

- **UI Layer (HTML/CSS)**: Renders the layout, buttons, and visual feedback
- **Logic Layer (JavaScript)**:
  - Handles user input and button events
  - Randomly generates computer’s move
  - Compares selections to decide the winner
  - Updates the DOM with results
- **Optional Enhancements**: Responsive layout and score tracking logic (can be toggled)

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology  | Purpose                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| HTML        | Page structure                     |
| CSS         | Visual styling                     |
| JavaScript  | Core logic and interactivity       |
| VS Code     | Code editor (recommended)          |

### 🚀 Execution Steps

1. **Clone or Download** this repository
2. **Navigate to the folder** in your local machine
3. **Open** `index.html` in any modern browser

```bash
open index.html   # macOS
start index.html  # Windows
```

> ✅ No server setup or build tools needed — just open and play!


### 📚 Key Concepts Explored

- DOM traversal and manipulation
- `addEventListener()` for capturing events
- Use of `Math.random()` for generating unpredictable results
- Conditional logic and game state tracking
- Separation of HTML, CSS, and JS for clean structure


### 🧠 Learnings

- Improved command over DOM APIs and event-driven programming
- Balanced logic between readability and functionality
- Learned to isolate UI rendering from business logic
- Responsive design made easier with flexbox (if applied)


### 📝 Summary

This Rock Paper Scissors mini project offers a fun way to strengthen frontend development skills using pure JavaScript. It reinforces foundational concepts like event handling, conditionals, and user interaction—all critical for larger-scale applications.
