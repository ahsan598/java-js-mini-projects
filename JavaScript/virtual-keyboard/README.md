# ⌨️ Virtual Keyboard – JavaScript Mini Project


### 📌 Project Overview

An interactive, browser-based **Virtual Keyboard** developed using **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It simulates a physical keyboard layout, provides visual feedback on **key clicks, and displays** typed characters in real time. Designed for beginners to practice **DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI interaction** in a hands-on way.

---

### 🎯 Objective

- Learn how to capture and handle virtual key clicks using JavaScript
- Practice DOM traversal, dynamic class toggling, and input rendering
- Understand how to map UI buttons to functional key actions
- Reinforce frontend development concepts without relying on external libraries


### 🧱 Architecture

- **HTML**: Defines the keyboard layout using buttons inside a structured grid
- **CSS**: Handles styling, key highlighting effects, and basic responsiveness
- **JavaScript**:
  - Adds click event listeners to each key
  - Displays key values in a live text area
  - Adds visual feedback (e.g. highlighting key on press)

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tool / Technology | Purpose                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| HTML              | Page structure             |
| CSS               | Styling and layout         |
| JavaScript        | Logic and interactivity    |
| VS Code           | Code editing               |
| Chrome / Edge     | Browser execution          |


### 🚀 Execution Steps

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. Open the project folder on your computer
3. Double-click or right-click `index.html` and **open in browser**

```bash
open index.html   # macOS  
start index.html  # Windows
```

> ✅ No server setup required — works entirely on the frontend.


### 📚 Key Concepts Explored

- DOM traversal and manipulation
- Event listeners and dynamic input display
- CSS class toggling for interaction feedback
- Grid/flex-based layout styling
- Keyboard-to-text area mapping logic


### 🧠 Learnings

- Gained confidence in real-time input handling via JavaScript
- Learned to manage UI feedback for button presses
- Balanced layout across screen sizes using basic responsive techniques
- Debugged cases where multiple button presses caused UI lag (if tackled)


### 📝 Summary

This project demonstrates how frontend developers can simulate hardware-like behavior using web technologies. It serves as a hands-on example of DOM interaction and keyboard logic — ideal for JavaScript learners looking to go beyond static websites.
